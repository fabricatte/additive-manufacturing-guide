When choosing a 3D printing technology for your next project, the decision often comes down to two dominant methods: **Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM)** and **Stereolithography (SLA)**. Both have their place in modern manufacturing, but understanding their differences is key to getting the best results.

## What Is FDM 3D Printing?

FDM works by extruding thermoplastic filament through a heated nozzle, building parts layer by layer. It's the most widely used 3D printing technology in the world — and for good reason.

**Strengths:**
- **Material variety** — PLA, PETG, ABS, ASA, TPU, Carbon Fiber composites, and more
- **Durability** — FDM parts are mechanically strong and suitable for functional applications
- **Cost-effective** — lower material costs and faster print times for larger parts
- **Scalability** — print farms can run dozens of printers simultaneously for production runs

**Best for:** Functional prototypes, production parts, jigs and fixtures, large-format prints

## What Is SLA 3D Printing?

SLA uses a UV laser to cure liquid photopolymer resin, producing parts with exceptional detail and surface quality. It's the go-to choice when precision matters most.

**Strengths:**
- **Surface quality** — smooth, high-resolution finish right off the printer
- **Dimensional accuracy** — tolerances as tight as ±0.05mm
- **Medical-grade materials** — biocompatible resins for healthcare applications
- **Fine detail** — ideal for intricate geometries and small features

**Best for:** Dental and medical devices, jewelry masters, detailed prototypes, cosmetic parts

## Head-to-Head Comparison

| Factor | FDM | SLA |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Surface Finish | Visible layer lines | Smooth, near-injection-mold |
| Strength | High (especially with engineering materials) | Moderate (brittle with standard resins) |
| Speed | Fast for large parts | Faster for small, detailed parts |
| Cost per Part | Lower for medium-large parts | Lower for small, detailed parts |
| Material Options | 50+ filament types | Growing resin library |
| Post-Processing | Support removal, optional sanding | Washing, UV curing required |

## When to Use Each

**Choose FDM when:**
- You need strong, functional parts
- The project involves larger components
- Cost efficiency matters at volume
- You're working with engineering-grade materials

**Choose SLA when:**
- Surface finish and detail are critical
- You need tight dimensional tolerances
- The application requires biocompatible materials
- Parts are small to medium-sized

## Why Not Both?

Many manufacturers — including [Fabricatte](https://www.fabricatte.com) — offer both FDM and SLA services. The smartest approach is often combining technologies: SLA for the precision components, FDM for the structural ones.
